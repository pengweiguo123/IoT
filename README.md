# IoT class project: Conrete Crack Detection and Quantification System Based on IoT

(1) The robotic car with raspberry is used to take photo of concrete cracks.

(2) The image is uploaded to PC via ftplib.

(3) Cracks are detected using trained semantic segmentation model - ResNet50 based LinkNet.
    
(4) The cracks are quantified based on computer vision and geometry.
